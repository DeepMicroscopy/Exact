TODO
====

The following TODOs have to be implemented and tested before we merge
this stuff to ```master```.

* annotation types need a Field for their tool type.
* the label representation has to be adapted
* verification stuff (drawing of the annotation)
* label editing
* the tool has to change according to the selected type
* other stuff
* import/export stuff
* annotation similarity
    * formatting of annotations has to be consistent (which point is which?)
